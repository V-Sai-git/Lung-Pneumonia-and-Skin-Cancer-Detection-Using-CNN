# Lung-Pneumonia-and-Skin-Cancer-Detection-Using-CNN

A hackathon prototype: a web app for lung, pneumonia, and skin cancer detection using CNNs (Keras/TensorFlow), with an HTML/CSS/JS frontend and a Python/Flask backend. 
It ingests medical images, runs model inference, and displays results via an intuitive UI.
Hadoop is used to provide scalable storage/management of large health datasets aimed at accelerating early screening with usable, fast feedback.
